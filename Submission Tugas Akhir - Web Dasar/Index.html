                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>
                    As an active student of the Information Systems study programme batch 2022 at Surabaya State University, I am currently in semester 5,
                    where I continue to hone my knowledge and skills in the field of information technology. I am known as an ambitious individual,always striving to think critically and analytically in facing various challenges.
                    My proactive approach to problem solving makes me better equipped to deal with complex situations.
                    Outside of formal studies, I have a deep interest in IT, especially in developing innovative and sustainable technology solutions. In addition, I am also active in martial arts activities,which not only help me maintain my physical health, but also build discipline and mental resilience.
                    Currently, I am actively involved in MSIB independent study activities at Bangkit Academy partners, where I focus on the cloud computing path. This experience allows me to put the theories I learnt in class into real practice, as well as expand my professional network in the industry. I believe that the combination of solid education, practical experience, and a passion for continuous learning will lead me to success in the future.

                <p>
                    Besides focusing on my studies, I am also actively involved in various organisations. This involvement not only provides valuable experience,
                    but also a means to practice important skills such as responsibility, communication, and management.Through organisations, I learned how to work together in a team, take initiative, and face challenges.
                    I participated in activities that required good coordination, as well as the ability to adapt to changing situations.
                    This experience not only strengthened my interpersonal skills, but also helped me understand group dynamics and effective ways to achieve common goals.

                    <p>
                        I play an active role as vice chairman in the UKM Radio UNESA organisation, where I have a great responsibility in carrying out tasks and leading the team.
                        In this position, I am directly involved in formulating strategic work programs, which not only focus on organisational development but also on improving the quality of the content we broadcast.
                        My involvement in the work programme formulation process includes identifying member and audience needs, as well as developing relevant and innovative initiatives.
                        I also collaborate with team members to implement various activities aimed at increasing listener engagement and satisfaction, such as organising events, workshops, and special broadcasts.
                        In addition, I was active in liaising with relevant parties to ensure smooth operations and support for our activities. Through this experience, I have learnt the importance of time management,
                        communication skills, and the ability to work under pressure.

                        Since 2022, I have been an active member in the organisation, where I am involved in the entrepreneurship sector. In this role, I contributed to setting up an independent business that not only serves as an internal source of income for the organisation,

                        Overall, the combination of being involved in organisations and sporting activities gave me a good balance between personal and professional development. These two experiences complemented each other and helped me become a more competitive individual,
